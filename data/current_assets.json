Farmers markets have been great and with the variety of markets that are in this area we could do 4-5 each week, if we only had the time, or manpower. maybe in the future that will change as we grow. We have products available year round, and no convenient marketplace for these outside of the summer months.",

At great cost to us (and a grant through the Department of Soil and Water) we have built a NYS licensed and inspected poultry processing facility on our farm (soon to be completed). this will allow us to sell our poultry to hotels and restaurants, institutions, and retail stores. Perhaps not the only option we had as a small farm wanting to grow, but based on my experience with direct sales it seemed a reasonable way to have access to our products more convenient for the consumer, restauranteur, and retailer."

Since we are open year-round and must buy produce from other areas in, our percentage that we grow does not meet the standard. It really is a shame because people come in wanting to use them and we have to turn them away. A PA farm store that we deal with can take the PA checks even with the same kind of setup that we have, it is pretty frustrating. We also do not fit in for the farmers market grants. Signage requirements and needing multiple terminals is what keeps us from trying to sign up for the EBT program (we have 3 registers and since we can't make EBT transactions go through one dedicated terminal since that would be discrimination in the eyes of the state). The fact that a 20-C processing license doesn't cover us for the FSMA guidelines is also frustrating- food safety is a huge issue but it would be nice if guidelines were in line with each other after we pay for the license each year and get audited, then to see people that have no license getting away with selling their items at a small shed on the side of the road that do not get audited- not that they are inherently dangerous products but it would be nice if there was a way to make sure that anyone making those food products has the knowledge base to keep the food system safe.
