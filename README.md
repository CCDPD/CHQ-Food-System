## Summary
During the initial meetings of the Chautauqua County Food Policy Council, the Council noted that while we have a foundational understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of Chautauqua County's food system, we are unaware of its specific assets. Understanding our assets and capacity will help the Council to formulate policy changes and program areas that will benefit the food system. Additionally, we hope that this will help develop and strengthen connections within Chautauqua County.
